As increasingly unstable features are removed, the performance drop between training and shifted environments decreases from 0.094 to approximately 0.08 AUC points. While in-environment performance declines gradually due to reduced feature expressiveness, the monotonic reduction in robustness degradation confirms that unstable features are a primary driver of out-of-distribution failure rather than model capacity alone.**\n"],"metadata":{"id":"5RLHF8YjYb2r"}}]}
